                        Each taking up half of a physical floor of the dorm. Think two stacks of four donuts each — that'll give you the right mental picture. Each floor houses between 3 and 14 residents, has a complete kitchen with stove, microwave, dishwasher, and up to four refrigerators, and also has two private bathrooms and a lounge. Seven of the floors are co-ed, and the other is non-male.
