                        Random Hall is MIT's smallest dormitory, providing housing for 93 residents. We're located just north of campus at 290 Massachusetts Avenue in the great city of Cambridge, MA. We're Building NW61 on the MIT campus map.

                        Random Hall was dedicated in 1968 on Leap Year's Day, and is now one of two undergraduate dorms on the northern side of the MIT campus. Our location near Central Square makes shopping and traveling through the entire Cambridge-Boston area extremely convenient. The MBTA Red Line and local H-mart are just a few blocks away, and A-plus market, open 24/7, is right next to us.

                        Random is divided into eight "floors," each taking up half of a physical floor of the dorm. Think two stacks of four donuts each--that'll give you the right mental picture. Each floor houses between 3 and 14 residents, has a complete kitchen with stove, microwave, dishwasher, and up to four refrigerators, and also has two private bathrooms and a lounge. Seven of the floors are co-ed, and the other is non-male.

                        In the basement one can find a computer room, a workshop, a darkroom, Random's MITnet printer, a music practice room, a weight room, a game area with a punching bag and pool table, and the Alice in Wonderland Theater. Our three washers (Geela, Malseka, Maku) and four dryers (Alatelo, Krank, Akoro, Droog), which residents can all use for free, are also located in the basement; their status can be checked online. The first floor features a large lounge where weekly study-breaks are held.

                        Our front desk sorts mail, runs soda fridge, lends movies, checks out shop keys, and provides sewing machines and/or vacuums to the hole-y and dust-ridden. On our roof we also have a wooden roofdeck with tables, chairs, meteor-gazing, movie-watching, boffer-fighting, or even tooling.
