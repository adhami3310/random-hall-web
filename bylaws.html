                <p>The Random Hall Budget shall be established by Random Hall on a term-by-term basis as described in Article V, Section 8 of the Random Hall Constitution. The Budget shall serve as a guide for the Vice President in disbursement of funds and the Committee chairpersons in spending of funds. No individual or group may be reimbursed for the purchase of an item unless it has been included in the Random Hall Budget or approved for reimbursement through a discretionary fund. The Vice-President shall be responsible for collecting and compiling the information needed to create the Budget, including but not limited to budget requests made by Committee Chairperson(s), budget requests made by floors of Random Hall, the amount of money in Random Hall&#39;s savings accounts, and the amount of income to be received by Random Hall through the House Tax. An ExecComm budget meeting shall be called within a week before the House Budget Meeting. All members of ExecComm, as well as all Committee Chairmen, shall attend this meeting. The purpose of this meeting shall be to discuss the budget compiled by the Vice-President, with each person who requested money explaining the purpose of the request. If the budget compiled by the Vice-President includes a budget deficit, changes in the amount of money allocated for various purposes shall be made in a way that is agreeable to all interested parties to eliminate the deficit. ExecComm shall then vote on whether to accept the proposed budget as it stands. Less than 24 hours after the end of the ExecComm budget meeting, the proposed budget shall be distributed to all voting members of Random Hall. At the House Budget Meeting, the Vice-President shall briefly go over all of the items in the budget and shall ask for any discussion of or changes to those items before the House votes on whether to approve the budget.</p>

                <p>Every Random Hall Budget shall include line items for an ExecComm discretionary fund, a President&#39;s discretionary fund, and a discretionary fund for each floor.</p>
                <p>The ExecComm discretionary fund shall act as a source of funding for requests and expenses not otherwise included in the Budget. Any individual or group requesting ExecComm discretionary funds must make the request of any member of ExecComm. That ExecComm member must inform the other members of ExecComm of the request at any time before the subsequent ExecComm meeting. The request must state both the reason for the request and the amount of money requested. The money shall be allocated from the ExecComm discresionary fund under the following conditions: at a regularly scheduled ExecComm meeting, with a simple majority of ExecComm; at an extraordinary meeting, only if four of the seven voting members of ExecComm vote to approve the allocation.</p>
                <p>The President&#39;s discretionary fund shall serve a purpose similar to the ExecComm discretionary fund. Any person or group requesting President&#39;s discretionary funds must make the request of the President. The request must state both the reason for the request and the amount of money requested. The President shall decide whether to allocate the funds within 48 hours of the request. Upon deciding to allocate President&#39;s discretionary funds, the President must inform the other members of ExecComm of his/her decision within 24 hours.</p>
                <p>Floor discretionary funds are a source of funding for specific types of purchases for a floor. Each floor&#39;s discretionary funds may be spent on either capital items or on community consumable items for the use of that floor. Capital items are items that are intended to last for a relatively long time, such as pots and pans, TVs, sound systems, etc. Community consumable items are items that will be used up, which the floor prefers to purchase in large quantities, and which will be available for the use of the floor. This includes baking supplies, spices, aluminum foil, etc.</p>
                <p>Floors may petition ExecComm for the ability to spend their floor budget outside of these guidelines. A request should be include the proposed purchase and the amount proposed to be spent. ExecComm shall decide whether or not to approve the petition by majority vote. ExecComm should decide whether to approve the request based on whether the request will benefit the floor.</p>
                <p>Each floor will decide its method for allocating floor funds (voting, discussion, etc.) at the beginning of each fall semester, and can change the method at any point.</p>

                <h3 id="single-gender-and-coed-floors">Single-Gender, and Coed Floors</h3>
                <p>Throughout Article V of the Random Hall Bylaws “gender” refers to a resident’s self-identified gender identity.</p>
                <p>Each floor may be single-gender, or coed. Only residents of a specified gender identity may live on single-gender floors. Any resident may live on a coed floor.</p>
                <p>The current status of each floor is: Destiny: single-gender (male); Loop: single-gender (female); Clam: coed; Bonfire: coed; Foo: coed; Black Hole: coed; BMF: single-gender (female); Pecker: coed.</p>
                <p>A floor may change its status if strictly greater than 2/3 of all current undergraduate floor residents vote to do so, at any time at least one year since the floor’s last change in status. A floor may not change to a status that is not satisfied by at least 2/3 of its current undergraduate population. After a floor changes its status, the change takes effect the next time a resident moves onto that floor. The floor’s new status will apply only to residents moving onto the floor subsequent to the change in status. Current residents of a floor may continue to live in their current rooms or move to different rooms on the same floor even if they do not satisfy the floor’s new status, so long as they have not moved to a different floor in Random Hall in the meantime.</p>
                <p>The RAC will ensure that the gender constraints of each floor are maintained, subject to the rules of the MIT Housing Office.</p>
                <h3 id="room-types">Room Types</h3>
                <p>Rooms with a room number ending in 1 (“1-rooms”), 3 (“3-rooms”), or 4 (“4-rooms”) are singles. Rooms with a room number ending in 2 (“2-rooms”) are doubles, except for room 112 which is considered a divided double. A room with a room number ending in 5 (“5-room” or “large half”) and the attached room with number ending in 5s (“5s-room” or “small half”) comprise a divided double. Room 112 is a divided double comprised of 112 (the “large half”) and 112s (the “small half”).</p>
                <p>Subject to the constraints of the floor it lies on, a divided double may be occupied by any two residents with no additional constraints on gender. Subject to the constraints of the floor it lies on, a 2-room may be occupied by two residents of different gender (i.e., a 2-room may be a “co-ed double”) only if one resident has been pulled into the room by the other (c.f. §4.2). Otherwise, a 2-room may only be occupied by two residents of the same gender.</p>
                <h2 id="room-assignments">Room Assignments</h2>
                <p>The RAC is in charge of room assignments for all undergraduate residents of Random Hall. The RAC will maintain a list of current room assignments accessible to all Random Hall residents. Room assignments must be approved by the MIT Housing Office, and the MIT Housing Office has the right to change room assignments at its discretion.</p>
                <p>Whenever a room is vacated or is expected to be vacated at the end of the current semester, or when a new resident is assigned to Random Hall, the RAC will initiate a period of room switching during which room assignments will be adjusted according to the procedures set forth in §§3-6. At the beginning of each Fall semester, room assignments for freshmen will be made according to the procedures set forth in §7. Room assignments may also change at other times under certain circumstances (c.f. §8).</p>
                <p>A “period of room switching” is defined as any contiguous period of time during which residents may submit preferences to move into one or many vacant or imminently vacant rooms.</p>
                <p>The RAC has final authority in making any and all decisions with regards to room assignments in Random Hall. Any decision made by the RAC may be appealed to the Random Hall Judicial Committee for arbitration.</p>
                <h2 id="priority">Priority</h2>
                <h3 id="priority-list">Priority List</h3>
                <p>The RAC will maintain a list of all Random Hall residents in order of priority (the “priority list”), accessible to all Random Hall residents. Any moves between rooms in Random Hall will be resolved in order of decreasing priority (i.e. if more than one resident wishes to move into a vacant or imminently vacant room, the resident with the highest priority gets it), except in the case of pull-ins (c.f. §4.2) or moving from one half of a divided double to the other (c.f. §4.3).</p>
                <p>The priority list is divided into contiguous sublists according to class year. Older classes have higher priority than younger classes. Class year for these purposes is determined by the year in which a resident first enrolled in MIT as an undergraduate, subject to RAC discretion in cases where the resident is visiting or transferring from another institution, or is returning to MIT from a leave of absence.</p>
                <h3 id="using-priority">Using priority</h3>
                <p>A resident will “use priority” whenever they move into a new room, except in the following cases: an upperclassman (i.e., non-freshman) moves into a double (i.e. 2-rooms except for 112), or a freshman moves into a double after the initial freshman room selection process (§7.2); the move is part of a room swap (c.f. §8); or the move is part of an emergency move (c.f. §9). A resident who moves from one half of a divided double to the other half uses priority (c.f. §4.3). At the end of each period of room switching, the RAC will adjust the priority list by removing all residents who have used their priority during that period of room switching and re-adding them to the end of their respective class year sublists in reverse order of their original priority.</p>
                <p>A resident who moves from one half of a divided double to the other half uses priority (c.f. §4.3).</p>
                <p>At the end of each period of room switching, the RAC will adjust the priority list by removing all residents who have used their priority during that period of room switching and re-adding them to the end of their respective class year sublists in reverse order of their original priority.</p>
                <h3 id="priority-for-newly-assigned-residents">Priority for newly-assigned residents</h3>
                <p>When a new resident is assigned to Random Hall, any currently active period of room switching (including priority adjustments as per §3.2) will first be resolved for current residents. Afterwards, any newly assigned residents in need of a room assignment will be added to the end of their class year’s priority list (in random order within each class year). There will then be a separate period of room switching during which the new residents will choose their rooms. Once the new residents have chosen rooms, their priorities will be adjusted as per §3.2.</p>
                <h2 id="squatting-and-pull-ins">Squatting and Pull-ins</h2>
                <h3 id="squatting">Squatting</h3>
                <p>Any upperclassman resident of Random who has moved into their assigned room has the right to “squat”, i.e., to keep their current room assignment during any period of room switching. A freshman resident has the right to squat after they have moved into their assigned room following the freshman room selection process (c.f. §7.2). A freshman does not have the right to squat in their temporary room (§7.1).</p>
                <p>Under certain emergency circumstances (c.f. §9), and as required by the MIT Housing Office, a resident may be required to change rooms despite his/her right to squat.</p>
                <h3 id="pull-ins-to-doubles-and-divided-doubles">Pull-ins to doubles and divided doubles</h3>
                <p>A resident who is assigned to a double or divided double following a period of room switching may “pull in” another resident as their roommate whenever the other spot in that room is available. The resident being pulled in must agree to be pulled in. A resident who is pulled into a room will get the spot regardless of priority. A resident who moves due to a pull-in still uses priority unless the move satisfies one of the exceptions listed in §3.2. Subject to the the floor’s gender constraints, a resident of a 2-room may pull in a resident of the another gender. Subject to the the floor’s gender constraints, a resident of either half of a divided double (large or small) may pull any other resident into the other half of the same divided double with no additional constraints on gender.</p>
                <h3 id="moving-between-halves-of-a-divided-double">Moving between halves of a divided double</h3>
                <p>Whenever one half of a divided double becomes available, the resident of the other half has the right to move to the vacated half before it is made available to other residents (even those with higher priority). A resident who moves from one half of a divided double to the other uses priority.</p>
                <h2 id="room-reassignments-between-semesters">Room Reassignments Between Semesters</h2>
                <h3 id="end-of-fall-term">End of Fall term</h3>
                <p>There will be a period of room switching near the end of each Spring semester. The RAC will email out a list of residents expected to return to Random Hall for the next school year. Using an online or paper form, each returning resident will indicate whether they wish to squat in their current room assignment or whether they wish to move to a different room for the next school year. A resident wishing to move to a different room will list the rooms they would like to move to, in order of preference, ending with his/her current room. For each double or divided double that a resident expresses a preference for (or is squatting in), the resident may also provide a list of other residents he/she would like to pull in (in order of preference) should he/she be placed in that room. Residents may also express other preferences that may or may not be honored by the RAC.</p>
                <p>The residents who will be moving as a result of the room switches will move during IAP, as directed by the MIT Housing Office. The MIT Housing Office may require residents who are moving out of Random Hall at the end of IAP to move to a temporary room during IAP.</p>
                <h3 id="end-of-spring-term">End of Spring term</h3>
                <p>There will be a period of room switching near the end of each Spring semester. The RAC will email out a list of residents expected to return to Random Hall for the next school year. Using an online or paper form, each returning resident will indicate whether they wish to squat in their current room assignment or whether they wish to move to a different room for the next school year. A resident wishing to move to a different room will list the rooms he/she would like to move to, in order of preference, ending with his/her current room. For each double or divided double that a resident expresses a preference for (or is squatting in), the resident may also provide a list of other residents he/she would like to pull in (in order of preference) should he/she be placed in that room. Residents may also express other preferences that may or may not be honored by the RAC.</p>
                <p>Conditional requests of the following forms will be honored whenever possible: “This room is my n-th preference only if I can pull in person A (or person B, or person C, etc.) as my roommate. If not, then this room is my m-th preference.” “This room is my n-th preference only if I can be pulled in by person A (or person B, or person C, etc.). If not, then this room is my m-th preference.” “This room is my n-th preference only if my roommate is person A (or person B, or person C, etc.). If not, then this room is my m-th preference.”</p>
                <p>Requests of the following form will be honored whenever possible if the Random Hall Judicial Committee deems it necessary due to a dispute between the residents involved: “I do not want to live in the same room as person A.” “I do not want to live on the same floor as person A.”</p>
                <p>Any other requests conditional on any other resident’s housing preferences will be ignored.</p>
                <p>The RAC will ensure that all returning residents (including those who wish to squat) submit a completed preference form by the specified deadline.</p>
                <p>Residents who have applied for 9th or 10th term housing for the following Fall semester will also complete a preference form. The RAC will resolve the preferences of such residents as if they were returning to Random Hall in the Fall. (However, as required by the MIT Housing Office, they will not officially be given room assignments for the Fall semester.) If the residents are subsequently denied 9th or 10th term housing, adjustments to the other residents’ room assignments will be made during the summer when this becomes apparent (c.f. §6.3).</p>
                <p>The RAC will first assign all residents who choose to squat to their current rooms. If any residents have listed the rooms being squatted in among their preferences, those preferences will be removed from consideration. If any residents have only their current room remaining as a valid choice, they will be placed in that room and the room will be removed from everyone else&#39;s preference lists. This will be repeated until no residents can be assigned in this manner. In order of highest to lowest priority, each remaining resident will be tentatively assigned to their highest-ranked room that has not yet been assigned. Each room that is tentatively assigned will be tentatively removed from everyone else&#39;s preference lists. If the tentatively assigned room ends up not being vacated by its current resident, then the tentative assignment will be reversed and that room will be removed from consideration for the resident who was tentatively assigned to it. This process will be repeated until there is a stable assignment of all residents to rooms. Any pull-in requests will be resolved as they arise.</p>
                <p>No resident will be assigned to a room they prefer less than their current room. No resident of a divided double whose roommate moves out of that room will be assigned to a room they prefer less than their preferred half of their current divided double. No resident will be pulled into a room they prefer less than any room they would otherwise have gotten.</p>
                <p>The priority list will be readjusted as per §3.2 at the end of this period of room switching. Afterwards, newly assigned residents (if any) will choose from among the available rooms in a second period of room switching.</p>
                <h2 id="room-reassignments-at-other-times">Room Reassignments at Other Times</h2>
                <h3 id="vacancies-at-other-times">Vacancies at other times</h3>
                <p>When a vacancy arises due to a resident moving out of Random at a time other than the end of the Fall or Spring semesters, the RAC will initiate a period of room switching and resolve the resulting moves in the same manner as for room switches at the end of each Fall semester (c.f. §5.1). If another vacancy arises while such a period of room switching is being resolved, the room will be made available for the same period of room switching, with residents being allowed to retroactively revise their submitted preferences if applicable.</p>
                <h3 id="vacancies-during-the-summer">Vacancies during the summer</h3>
                <p>If any vacancies arise due to one or many residents switching to a different dorm or cancelling their housing during the summer, the RAC will retroactively adjust the results of the previous period of room switching using the preferences collected at the end of the last Spring term.</p>
                <h3 id="9th-or-10th-term-seniors-denied-housing">9th or 10th term seniors denied housing</h3>
                <p>During the summer, if it becomes clear that residents who have applied for 9th or 10th term housing will not be granted housing (e.g. if new residents are assigned to Random such that there are not enough spots left for the prospective 9th or 10th term residents), the RAC will retroactively adjust the results of the previous period of room switching using the preferences collected at the end of the last Spring term.</p>
                <h3 id="new-residents-assigned-after-freshman-temporary-assignments-have-been-made">New residents assigned after freshman temporary assignments have been made</h3>
                <p>As required by the MIT Housing Office, freshmen’s temporary room assignments (c.f. §7.1) cannot be changed after they are made. If there are new residents assigned to Random Hall after freshman temporary assignments have been made, these new residents will be given temporary rooms (which they can squat in if they so desire) to stay in until the freshman room selection process (§7.2). If they so desire, these new residents can choose new rooms (in order of priority) from among the vacant rooms and rooms temporarily occupied by freshmen or new residents in a special period of room switching preceding the freshman room selection process. Any pull-ins will be resolved as they arise. The priority list will be readjusted as per §3.2 at the end of this period of room switching.</p>
                <h2 id="freshman-room-assignments">Freshman Room Assignments</h2>
                <h3 id="temporary-freshman-room-assignments">Temporary Freshman Room Assignments</h3>
                <p>Before each Fall term, the freshmen assigned to Random Hall in the Freshman Summer Housing Lottery will be assigned temporary rooms at the discretion of the RAC, based on their responses to the MIT Housing questionnaire. Two freshmen of different gender may be assigned to the same temporary room (i.e. a co-ed double) if they both indicate that they prefer a co-ed double. Freshmen assigned to temporary rooms in Random Hall do not have squatting rights to their temporary room.</p>
                <h3 id="freshman-room-selection-process-and-floor-rush">Freshman Room Selection Process and Floor Rush</h3>
                <p>On the evening designated by MIT Housing, following the announcement of First Year Residence Exchange (FYRE) results, the freshmen assigned to Random Hall will assemble and the RAC will hold a brief informational meeting to explain the room assignment procedures and the rooms available to the freshmen. Following this meeting, the freshmen will be taken on a tour of the dorm to see all of the floors and to see the available types of rooms. There will be a period of at least 90 minutes during which freshmen may visit floors at will (“floor rush”). During floor rush, the RAC will be available to meet privately with freshmen who may have special circumstances (c.f. §7.5) and freshmen who wish to live in a co-ed double (c.f. §7.6). Following floor rush, the freshmen must assemble for the freshman room selection meeting, which is open to any Random Hall residents who wish to observe. The list of freshman priorities (c.f. §7.3) will be revealed. Freshmen who are pulled in by upperclassmen (c.f. §7.4) are assigned to rooms. In order of priority, each remaining freshman will choose their room from among the remaining available rooms. If a freshman selects an empty double or divided double, he/she may pull in another freshman as his/her roommate, provided the freshman being pulled in consents to the pull-in. This process continues until each freshman is assigned to a suitable room. At some point during the freshman room selection meeting, the RAC may need to announce that no more freshmen of a particular gender may choose rooms on co-ed floors, in order to ensure that there are suitable rooms remaining for all remaining unassigned freshmen. To this end, the RAC should keep a careful count of the number of remaining spots suitable for each gender, and the number of remaining unassigned freshmen of each gender, at all times throughout the freshman room selection meeting.</p>
                <h3 id="freshman-priorities">Freshman Priorities</h3>
                <p>Prior to the freshman room selection meeting, the freshman priority list will be generated by repeatedly randomly permuting the freshmen assigned to Random Hall until all freshmen with special circumstances (c.f. §7.5) have a suitable priority, or by any equivalent randomization process. The freshman priority list will not be revealed until immediately prior to the freshman room selection meeting.</p>
                <p>After the freshman room selection meeting, the freshman priority list will be completely reversed. In other words, all freshmen who are assigned rooms during the room selection meeting (including those who are pulled in) will use priority.</p>
                <h3 id="pull-ins-of-freshmen-by-upperclassmen">Pull-ins of freshmen by upperclassmen</h3>
                <p>Upperclassmen who wish to pull in a freshman must be present at the freshman room selection meeting, or designate a proxy who will be present at the freshman room selection meeting. Such pull-in requests must be made in person at the beginning of the freshman room selection meeting. The freshman being pulled in must agree to be pulled in.</p>
                <h3 id="freshmen-with-special-circumstances">Freshmen with special circumstances</h3>
                <p>A freshman whose room choices are limited by special circumstances (including but not limited to medical, religious, or personal circumstances) should make the RAC aware of their situation prior to the freshman room selection meeting. The RAC will keep any such circumstances confidential unless the freshman gives the RAC permission to discuss them with the Head-of-House, GRTs, RLAD, or Judicial Committee. The RAC will determine the set of available rooms which the freshman with a special circumstance would be able to live in, and will determine the lowest possible priority that would guarantee that the freshman would be able to choose one of the suitable rooms. When determining the list of freshman priorities (c.f. §7.3), the RAC will ensure that the freshman with a special circumstance has no lower than that priority. This may be conditional on gender.</p>
                <h3 id="freshman-room-adjustment-period">Freshman room adjustment period</h3>
                <p>At least one month after the freshman room selection process (preferably coinciding with the Columbus Day holiday, to facilitate moving), there will be a special period of room switching open only to freshmen and any upperclassmen who did not live in Random Hall during the previous Spring semester. During this period of room switching, eligible residents may express interest in moving to any rooms currently vacant or occupied by another such eligible resident. Moves will be resolved in order of priority. Any pull-ins will be resolved as they arise. The priority list will be readjusted as per §3.2 at the end of this period of room switching.</p>

                <p>In the case that a new resident assigned to Random Hall has special circumstances (including but not limited to medical, religious, or personal circumstances) limiting the rooms in which that resident can live, or in the case that a current resident encounters a special circumstance which makes them temporarily or permanently unable to live in their current room assignment, the RAC will facilitate an emergency move. The resident will contact the RAC (either directly or through the MIT Housing Office, Head-of-House, RLAD, a GRT, or a member of the Judicial Committee) to explain their special circumstance, and the RAC will make every effort to ensure that a suitable room can be made available to the resident. If no suitable room is currently available, the RAC will contact the current occupants of any rooms suitable for the resident with a special circumstance and ask for volunteers to swap rooms with the resident. If there are no volunteers, the resident of such a suitable room with the lowest priority will be asked to swap rooms with the resident with a special circumstance. No resident may be involuntarily displaced from their room more than once during their tenure at Random Hall. In either case, the displaced resident will be compensated with an increase in priority for the duration of the swap, subject to the discretion of the RAC, and is guaranteed to be able to return to the room they were displaced from (if they so desire) when it next becomes available again.</p>
