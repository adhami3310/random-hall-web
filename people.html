                Friendly Neighbors
            </h2>
            <p>
                Random Hall is filled with friendly upperclassmen (and, we hope, friendly freshmen too), who are good not only for hanging out but also for getting academic help and general advice. Randomites are more than happy to help with understanding problem sets, studying for tests, and just figuring out how things work. Because we have a variety of majors and interests, there's almost always someone able to help. Our expertise, however, do not start and end in the realm of academics.
            </p>
            <p>
                Randomites form a tight community and are always there for one another. You can be sure to find someone to help you adjust to college life, deal with academic pressure, handle problems back at home, etc.

            </h2>
            <p>
                Random's three friendly Graduate Resident Advisors are neither academic advisors (though they, like our other residents, will usually help with academics if asked) nor rule-enforcers. They do add sanity and something resembling an adult presence to the floors. Often seen as "big brothers," (in the friendly sibling sense, not the Orwellian sense) they are there to talk to when you need it.

                Heads of House
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Heads of House are the dorm's adults; they live with us, offer advice and counseling, sponsor dorm events, and are a liason to the Deans, MIT Medical, the faculty, and the administration. Random’s Heads of House care deeply about students' mental and physical health, and they’re here to support Randomites during tough times as well as share in the happy moments. You can stop by their apartment on the first floor anytime to chat about your challenges, struggles, and victories at MIT. They bring to Random excitement, curiosity, and a friendly little dog.

                Area Director
            </h2>
            <p>
                The Area Director supports Random’s Heads of House and the GRAs to help foster supportive and inclusive community within the Hall. Along side the Heads of house, they can be an advocate and liaison within MIT and encourage success outside in your personal and professional life. Their office is behind the Front Desk in Foo and are available by phone, text, email, and designated office hours! In addition to providing monthly study breaks open to the entire Hall, the Area Director helps support the community through individual and group coaching, advising, administrative processing, and advocacy. If you have any issues, concerns or you just want to chat, feel free to reach out!

                SocComm
            </h2>
            <p>
                SocComm makes life at the Institute a tad bit more fun by providing residents with parties, dinners, trips, and other miscellaneous fun activities. Whether kickin' it old school on the dance floor, driving to New Hampshire to look at the fall leaves, or just chillin' in the basement with some food and games, SocComm is there to serve!

                ExecComm
            </h2>
            <p>
                Random is ruled by the Executive Committee, lovingly known as ExecComm. Most of Random's governing structures have 'Comm' in their names because none of us can spell comiteee. ExecComm is composed of the 'High Council' and non-voting positions. The High Council has a president, vice-president/treasurer, secretary, and four representatives. The non-voting positions include SocComm (planning social functions); Video Chair (acquiring movies for our library); Rush Chair; Laundry Empress (males can be Empresses, too); and Earth, Wind & Fire God (watering the plants and take care of the grill on the roofdeck).
            </p>
            <p>
                Our government is far from oppressive and is very open to input from everyone. Many freshmen are elected to positions in their first term.

                JudComm
            </h2>
            <p>
                JudComm is the judiciary branch of our dorm government. Its members provide arbitration in disputes and enforce dorm rules (of which there are very few). Most dorm problems can be handled internally, generally without even involving JudComm.

                Study Breaks
            </h2>
            <p>
                Almost every week of a term, the residents of Random gather for food and a break from studying. Each floor is responsible for organizing one study break a term (the dorm supplies the monetary funds).
