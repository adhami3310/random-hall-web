Think two stacks of four donuts each â€” that'll give you the right mental picture. Each floor houses between 3 and 14 residents, has a complete kitchen with stove, microwave, dishwasher, and up to four refrigerators, and also has two private bathrooms and a lounge. Seven of the floors are co-ed, and the other is non-male.</div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="the laundry room in random hall basement" src="/images/washers.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">In the basement,</h2>one can find a computer room, a workshop, a printer, a music practice room, a weight room, a game area with a punching bag and pool table, and the Alice in Wonderland Theater. Our three washers (Geela, Malseka, Maku) and four dryers (Alatelo, Krank, Akoro, Droog), which residents can all use for free, are also located there; their status can be checked online.</div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="random hall front desk with a worker" src="/images/front-desk.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Our front desk</h2>sorts mail, runs soda fridge, lends movies, checks out shop keys, and provides sewing machines and/or vacuums to the hole-y and dust-ridden.</div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="the roofdeck view at night" src="/images/roofdeck.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Our roof</h2>is open for all residents.

Each type of room has its own quirks and personality but every room has, for each occupant, one network connection, and an MIT standard desk, chair, bookcase, dresser and bed. In addition, rooms are generally personalized by their residents to some degree, the redecoration ranging from posters on the wall to complete paint jobs and replacement furniture, often built by the students.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="an illustration of the layout of most floors" src="/images/layout.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Types of rooms</h2><ul><li><b>One Rooms</b>are singles in the front of the building, facing Mass Ave.</li><li><b>Two Rooms</b>are doubles next to the one rooms, also facing out to the street.</li><li><b>Three Rooms</b>are singles which look out onto the air and light shafts in the middle of the building.</li><li><b>Four Rooms</b>are singles divided into two halves by arches, and also look out on the shafts.</li><li><b>Five Rooms</b>are divided doubles with outside windows facing the back of the building.

We are located northwest of main campus, on the edge of Central Square. A great benefit of this is that we are very close to a large number of restaurants, which are, in many cases, cheaper and better quality than the on-campus dining options. Added to this is the fact that we have plenty of kitchen space and a supermarket just around the corner, so many of our residents don't eat on campus at all. We are also quite close to the Central Square T stop, making us the closest dorm to a T stop of all of the dorms west of Mass. Ave.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="a frontview of counters at CVS" src="/images/cvs.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Off-Campus?</h2><p>The idea of living "off campus" often raises a couple of questions: "Isn't it a long way to walk to campus?" and "Do you feel safe being off campus?". To answer the first question, we are only a five minute walk from Lobby Seven, which is exactly the same distance as Burton Connor, one of the closer of the West Campus dorms. As far as safety is concerned, we have had no problems. The walk from campus to Random is entirely along Mass Ave, a busy, populated street, which can make it a lot safer than walks along smaller roads, such as Memorial Drive and Amherst Alley, routes to the West Campus dorms, after dark.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="picture of the main lounge" src="/images/main-lounge.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Main Lounge</h2><p>Our main lounge, located on Foo Floor, is the venue for most of the large gatherings that take place, including parties, dorm government meetings, and group homework sessions, to name a few. The main lounge also contains a kitchen (behind a bar known, of course, as the Foo bar), a TV, and our homebuilt 24-inch subwoofer.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="picture of a resident using the saw to cut a piece of wood" src="/images/shop.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Workshop</h2><p>Random has a small but well stocked shop in the basement, equipped with a table saw, drill press, and scroll saw, along with a set of pneumatic tools and an air compressor, plus a fairly complete selection of hand tools, powered and otherwise, good for just about any fairly small project.</p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="image-left"><div class="side-image-container"><img class="side-image" alt="picture of the study room" src="/images/study.webp"/></div><div class="side-text"><div class="side-text-content"><h2 class="section-header">Study Room</h2><p>The basement contains a kitchen that is rarely used, and thus functions as a quiet study room for Randomites.
